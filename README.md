# Litplacer_8mm_Indexers
8mm Tape Indexers based on  dining-philosopher / litefeeders
[Many thanks to dining-philosopher for this awesome design]

I have slightly modified it to suite my needs, and using resin 3d and fdm printed dog with the pin printed and not glued in, I found the dog with the printed pin worked a lot better than the dog with the glued in pin.

The 2nd design embraces clear blister pack tapes
